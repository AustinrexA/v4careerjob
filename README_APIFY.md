# Apify + Naukri integration for Phase 3

## Before running
- Keep your existing Phase 2/3 MySQL tables.
- Put `APIFY_API_TOKEN` in the project-root `.env`.
- The token must never be committed to Git or pasted into chat.
- Check the Actor's current pricing, input schema, source terms, and your company's permission to collect/store/reuse results before running.

## .env
Add to your existing root `.env`:
```dotenv
APIFY_API_TOKEN=your_real_token_here
APIFY_NAUKRI_ACTOR_ID=automation-lab~naukri-scraper
APIFY_ACCESS_APPROVED_NAUKRI=false
```
Do not replace the existing DB settings.

## Install
```powershell
pip install apify-client
```
Also add `apify-client` to `requirements.txt`.

## Run a small test
From the project root, run:
```powershell
python scripts/run_naukri_apify.py --keyword "Python Developer" --location "Chennai" --max-results 1
```

This script uses the existing `collectors.normalization.normalize_job` and `collectors.repository.save_jobs` functions. It expects the Phase 3 project files and Phase 2 database tables to already exist.

The Actor is third-party and is not an official Naukri integration. Start with one result, review output and cost in Apify, and scale only after the data and permitted use have been validated.


## Built-in candidate Actors (review before enabling)

The generic runner includes these candidate Actor IDs and source-specific input defaults, checked against their Apify Store pages on 2026-10-14. They are prefilled as convenience defaults in `.env.example`; no Actor is executed until its approval flag is explicitly enabled:

- Indeed India: `unfenced-group~indeed-in-scraper`
- Foundit: `deriverge~foundit-jobs-scraper`
- Internshala: `automation-lab~internshala-scraper`
- TimesJobs: `unfenced-group~timesjobs-scraper`
- Wellfound: `cprussin~wellfound-jobs`

They are community-maintained, can change or stop working, and may charge usage fees. Do not treat listing a source in the dashboard as proof that collection has succeeded. Before enabling a source, open its Store page, review the current input/output schema, pricing and applicable terms, then run a small test. Set `APIFY_ACCESS_APPROVED_<PORTAL_KEY>=true` only after you have decided to use that Actor and verified that your intended collection and reuse are permitted. These approval flags default to `false`; the batch runner skips sources without explicit approval.

Default input schemas are selected per portal by `scripts/run_source_apify.py`. To override one, set `APIFY_INPUT_<PORTAL_KEY>` to a single-line JSON object matching the selected Actor's current schema. Supported placeholders are `{keyword}`, `{location}`, and `{max_results}`. Internshala's selected Actor accepts a keyword and job/internship mode but has no location input; use V4Career's dashboard filters to narrow the stored results by location.

The default Actor IDs are also written to `.env.example` for convenience. Your existing `.env` is intentionally not included in ZIP files; copy only the relevant variable names/values into your local `.env` and never share your token.

## Company career-site collectors

V4Career includes a separate company-career catalog and configurable Apify runner. It deliberately does **not** assume that one Actor's input format works for every employer site. Before enabling any source, confirm the site's terms and the selected Actor's current input/output schema and pricing.

For each company, add three variables to your local `.env`. Example for TCS (replace the placeholder Actor and JSON with an Actor you have reviewed):

```dotenv
APIFY_ACTOR_COMPANY_TCS=owner~your-reviewed-actor
APIFY_ACCESS_APPROVED_COMPANY_TCS=false
APIFY_INPUT_COMPANY_TCS={"startUrls":[{"url":"{start_url}"}],"maxRequestsPerCrawl":20}
```

`APIFY_INPUT_COMPANY_TCS` must match the selected Actor's real schema; the example JSON is only illustrative and is not guaranteed to work with an arbitrary Actor. Set the approval flag to `true` only after you have reviewed and approved that specific collection method. Supported placeholders are `{start_url}`, `{keyword}`, `{location}`, and `{max_results}`.

Test a single source first:

```powershell
python scripts/run_company_career_apify.py --source TCS --keyword "Software Engineer" --location India --max-results 5
```

Run every company source that has an Actor ID, input JSON, and explicit approval:

```powershell
python scripts/run_company_careers_batch.py --keyword "Software Engineer" --location India --max-results 10
```

The runner maps common job fields, fills a missing company name from the selected employer, validates records with the existing normalizer, writes collection history, and stores through the existing repository with `source_type="company_career"`. URL-hash deduplication remains in place. A successful Actor run does not guarantee that all returned jobs are India-based; review a small test dataset and apply the Actor's documented India/location filters before increasing the result limit.

No Actor is pre-approved or enabled by this code. Career sites that require login, bypass access controls, or prohibit the intended collection/reuse must not be scraped.

## Official company-career collection (no Apify Actor required)

The built-in structured collector is a conservative alternative to generic page-text scraping. It only stores records marked as `schema.org/JobPosting` in JSON-LD, checks that the listing identifies the configured employer when that field is supplied, requires an India-indicating location, validates the job URL against configured official hosts, and rejects ordinary career/program descriptions. It does not bypass logins, CAPTCHAs, access controls, or robots/terms restrictions. Some career sites render listings in JavaScript or use a separate ATS; those sources may return zero results until a verified official ATS hostname or approved Actor is configured.

Run one company first:

```powershell
python scripts/run_company_career_structured.py --source TCS --max-results 10 --max-pages 20
```

Run all 15 catalog companies:

```powershell
python scripts/run_company_careers_structured_batch.py --max-results 50 --max-pages 60
```

The collector reports checked pages and actual JobPosting records. A successful zero-result run means pages were accessible but no valid India-located JobPosting JSON-LD was found; it does not fabricate vacancies. If no configured page can be fetched, the runner records a failed collection run when the database is available.

### Optional official ATS hosts

The collector starts at the official career URLs in `collectors/company_career_catalog.py` and follows job-like links only on that host and its subdomains. If an official career page links to a separate ATS domain, first verify that domain from the company's official site, then add only that hostname to the matching `CAREER_ALLOWED_HOSTS_<KEY>` variable in your local `.env`. Do not add a domain merely because it appears in a scraper result.

### Optional Apify fallback

The existing `scripts/run_company_career_apify.py` remains available for sites that do not expose usable structured listings. It still requires a reviewed Actor ID, a valid Actor-specific input JSON, an explicit `APIFY_ACCESS_APPROVED_<KEY>=true`, and `APIFY_API_TOKEN`. No Actor IDs, tokens, or approval flags are preconfigured by this change.

A source being listed in the UI or having this collector available does not prove it currently returns vacancies. Test each source and review the dataset/output before relying on its counts.
